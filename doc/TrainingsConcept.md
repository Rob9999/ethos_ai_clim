# **Training Concept for EthosAI - CLIM**

## **Overview**

The **Training Concept** for the EthosAI system is designed to optimize each layer of the **Current Life Imagination Model (CLIM)**. The CLIM Stack consists of multiple layers that each handle different aspects of decision-making, including ethical considerations, individual preferences, short- and medium-term strategies, and long-term planning.

The training process ensures that each layer in the CLIM Stack can learn from real-world scenarios, improving over time through feedback loops and iterative refinement.

## **CLIM Training Framework**

### **1. Training Objectives**

The primary goals of the training process are:
1. **Optimize Decision-Making**: Ensure that each layer of the CLIM Stack produces accurate and reliable decisions for the situations it handles.
2. **Layer-Specific Refinement**: Train each layer to handle its specific role (e.g., ethical decision-making, short-term optimization) based on targeted test cases.
3. **Long-Term Learning**: Ensure that the model incorporates new knowledge over time, using long-term memories to refine future decisions.

## **Training Methodology**

### **1. Layer-Specific Training**

Each layer of the CLIM Stack is trained separately to ensure that it performs optimally within its designated role. The layers to be trained are:

- **ETHIC Layer**: Focuses on training ethical decision-making through scenarios that require moral evaluation.
- **INDIVIDUAL Layer**: Trained to handle personal and individual needs, ensuring decisions align with personal goals.
- **SAMT Layer**: Optimizes short- and medium-term decisions, balancing immediate priorities with available resources.
- **LCLIM Layer**: Trained to analyze long-term consequences and make strategic decisions based on broader knowledge and experience.

### **2. Training Data**

Training data consists of **test case JSON files** that define specific situations, expected outcomes, and decision pipelines. These files simulate real-world scenarios that the CLIM Stack will need to evaluate.

**Test Case Format**:
```json
{
  "scenario": "Should a car swerve to avoid a pedestrian in a crosswalk?",
  "pipeline": "standard",
  "expected": {
    "ethic_layer": "STOP",
    "individual_layer": "GO",
    "samt_layer": "ADJUST",
    "lclim_layer": "GO"
  }
}
```

**Fields**:
- **Scenario**: Description of the scenario being tested.
- **Pipeline**: Specifies which decision pipeline will be used (e.g., **standard** or **emergency**).
- **Expected**: Defines the expected decisions from each layer for that scenario.

### **3. Decision Pipelines**

Training scenarios are processed through different **decision pipelines**, each designed for specific types of decisions:

- **Standard Pipeline**: Used for routine, non-critical decisions.
- **Emergency Pipelines**: Shortened decision paths designed for high-priority scenarios, such as life-or-death situations.

### **4. Feedback Loop and Refinement**

After each scenario is processed, the CLIM Stack receives feedback. The feedback loop includes the following steps:
1. **Execution**: Each layer processes the input scenario and outputs a decision.
2. **Comparison**: The output is compared with the expected result defined in the test case.
3. **Feedback**: Feedback is provided to refine the model, ensuring that future decisions become more accurate.

The **training loop** continuously refines each layer until it meets the desired performance criteria.

## **Training Phases**

### **1. Initial Training**

In the initial training phase, the system is trained with a baseline set of test cases. These cases are carefully chosen to cover a wide range of potential scenarios, including routine decisions, moral dilemmas, and emergency situations.

**Steps**:
1. **Load Baseline Test Cases**: A set of foundational test cases is used to initialize the training process.
2. **Run Pipelines**: Each test case is processed through the appropriate pipeline, with decisions being made by each layer.
3. **Refinement**: After processing, the system uses the feedback loop to adjust its decision-making parameters.

### **2. Layer-Specific Training**

Each layer is trained independently, focusing on its particular role in the decision-making process.

**Steps**:
1. **ETHIC Layer**: Trained using scenarios that challenge moral reasoning.
2. **INDIVIDUAL Layer**: Focuses on personal decision-making based on individual preferences.
3. **SAMT Layer**: Handles short- and medium-term decisions, optimizing for immediate outcomes.
4. **LCLIM Layer**: Focuses on long-term strategic analysis and decision-making.

### **3. Iterative Refinement**

Once the baseline training is complete, iterative refinement takes place to further optimize the model. This phase involves running additional test cases, updating the model, and continuously improving its performance.

**Steps**:
1. **Run New Test Cases**: The system is periodically tested with new scenarios.
2. **Refine Decisions**: Layers are refined based on the results of the new test cases.
3. **Monitor Performance**: The system's overall decision-making capabilities are monitored to ensure continued improvement.

### **4. Long-Term Learning (Dream Phase)**

In the **Dream Phase**, the CLIM system reflects on previous decisions and integrates new knowledge into its long-term memory. This phase happens during periods of inactivity, allowing the system to optimize its performance without the pressure of real-time decision-making.

## **Test Case Creation Process**

### **1. Creating Test Case Files**

Test cases are stored as **JSON files** and describe specific situations the CLIM Stack will evaluate. These cases should be created based on real-world scenarios and ethical dilemmas that the system will need to resolve.

### **2. Using the Prompt Manager**

The **Prompt Manager** generates prompts for each layer of the pipeline based on the scenario described in the test case. Each prompt asks the respective layer to make a decision, providing a standardized format for the training process.

**Prompt Example for ETHIC Layer**:
```
Analyze the ethical implications of the following situation: "A self-driving car encounters a pedestrian in a crosswalk." Based on your analysis, what is the best course of action? Provide a decision: [STOP, GO, NOGO, EMERGENCY, ADJUST].
```

---

## **Evaluation Metrics**

After training, each layer of the CLIM Stack is evaluated based on its ability to meet the following criteria:

1. **Accuracy**: How closely does the output match the expected result for each scenario?
2. **Consistency**: Are similar decisions made consistently across different but related scenarios?
3. **Responsiveness**: How quickly can the system make decisions, especially in high-priority scenarios?
4. **Ethical Soundness**: Are the decisions made by the ETHIC Layer aligned with ethical guidelines?
5. **Individual Satisfaction**: Does the INDIVIDUAL Layer produce outcomes that align with personal preferences and goals?

---

## **Emergency Training**

The CLIM Stack also requires training for emergency situations, where decisions must be made quickly. These emergency pipelines bypass some layers to provide faster decisions.

### **Emergency Pipelines**

1. **Survival Pipeline**: For life-threatening scenarios where immediate action is required.
   - Layers: ETHIC (Survival), SAMT (Survival)

2. **Essential Pipeline**: For situations that require essential actions but are not life-threatening.
   - Layers: ETHIC (Essential), SAMT (Essential), INDIVIDUAL (Essential)

3. **Recommended Pipeline**: For non-critical, recommended tasks where action is advised but not required.
   - Layers: SAMT (Recommended), INDIVIDUAL (Recommended)

**Training Process for Emergency Pipelines**:
- Emergency pipelines are tested using high-priority scenarios that require quick decision-making.
- The system is evaluated based on its speed and accuracy in these scenarios.

## **Conclusion**

The training concept for the EthosAI CLIM system is designed to ensure that each layer performs its role optimally. Through iterative training and feedback loops, the CLIM Stack continually improves its ability to make ethical, individual, and situationally appropriate decisions. The **Dream Phase** allows for long-term learning, further enhancing the system's capabilities.

Each phase of the training process—from initial training to iterative refinement—ensures that the CLIM system remains adaptive, responsive, and capable of handling a wide range of real-world scenarios.
