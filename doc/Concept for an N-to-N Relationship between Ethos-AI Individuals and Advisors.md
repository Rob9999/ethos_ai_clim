### Concept for an N-to-N Relationship between Ethos-AI Individuals and Advisors

#### 1. System Overview

**Ethos-AI Individuals** regularly connect to a central server (Association) to:

- Submit status reports (e.g., system health, active tasks).
- Receive training data (new test cases, refined prompts).
- Perform maintenance and updates (e.g., model updates, software patches).
- Enable communication with other Ethos-AI Individuals (e.g., knowledge transfer, coordination).

**Advisors** also connect to the server to:

- Handle training requests (e.g., submitting new test cases, refining existing prompts).
- Provide feedback (e.g., analyzing test runs, correcting misbehavior).
- Manage training and maintenance plans (e.g., scheduling training sessions).
- Enable communication with other Advisors (e.g., discussing issues, joint decision-making).

#### 3. Data Structure and Protocols

**3.1. Registration and Authentication**

**Registration:**
- Ethos-AI Individuals and Advisors register with the central server.
- Each entity receives a unique ID and corresponding authentication credentials.

**Authentication:**
- Ensuring that only authorized entities can access the system.
- Using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

**3.2. Status Reports**

- Regular submission of current status (e.g., training progress, system condition, active tasks).
- Storage of reports in the central server's database for analysis by Advisors.

**3.3. Training and Maintenance Data**

**Training Data:**
- Management of test cases, prompts, refinements, and results.
- Assignment and distribution of training data to respective Ethos-AI Individuals.

**Maintenance Data:**
- Management of maintenance plans (e.g., software updates, system checks).
- Logging of maintenance operations performed.

**3.4. Communication Protocols**

- Ethos-AI Individuals and Advisors communicate via encrypted message protocols.
- Messages can be relayed directly or through the central server.
- Logging of all communications for analysis and traceability.

#### 4. Security Concept

- TLS/SSL encryption for all data transmissions.
- Strong authentication (e.g., two-factor authentication).
- Role-based access control to manage permissions for Ethos-AI Individuals and Advisors.
- Regular security audits and updates of the entire system.
